# MarioBros-MachineLearning

Hello, welcome to this github repository. 

During my internship at IRIT (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse) I was asked to compare performance between the multi-agent system AMOEBA (developed during a thesis that took place at the SMAC team of IRIT) and some others machine learning algorithm.
We compare them using the MarioAI Benchmark [Karkovskiy et al. 2012].

I took the benchmark from this github repository https://github.com/zerg000000/mario-ai.

Three mains methods emerged from my preliminary study.
* Deep Q Learning [Mnih et al. 2013].
* NEAT [Stanley et al. 2002].
* NEAT + Q [Whiteson et al. 2006].
